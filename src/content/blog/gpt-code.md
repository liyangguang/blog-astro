*Check out [Part I](./gpt-overview) for general knowledge about GPT.*

In this article, I'll go through a few key APIs you need to know to build GPT applications! Reference OpenAI [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) and [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) for official up-to-date information.

## Pre-requisite

1. You need to create a free account on OpenAI, and generate an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). (Note, the ChatGPT chatbot and the developer dashboard are totally separated).
    - The API usage is not free, but OpenAI gives free credit to new users.
1. Assuming you are familiar with JS/TS, Node, NPM.
